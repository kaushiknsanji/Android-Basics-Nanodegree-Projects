**Quiz of Aves** is a Quiz App on **Birds**, that has a total of **50** questions in variety of formats such as "free text response", checkboxes (Multi-choice) and radio buttons (Single-choice). It presents the user with a randomly selected set of questions (read from the String resources) for the number of questions the user wishes to take the quiz, with options for "Multi-choice" and "Single-choice" questions displayed in a random order. For each question, user is presented with an optional Hint after an incorrect attempt, that shows an Image of the Bird(s) in question as a hint when requested by the user to reveal the hint, which in turn means that the user gets a second chance to answer each question. Entire quiz is timed, and the timer value is set accordingly to the number of questions selected by the user, by allocating 45 seconds for each question. The timer runs even when the app goes into background. At the end of the quiz, a dialog will show up for displaying the final score to the user.

#### Topics learnt/explored
* `android.os.AsyncTask` for downloading the images for each of the questions. Headless [`Fragment`](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/Bird_Quiz_App/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/birdquiz/ImageDownloaderTaskFragment.java) has been used for managing this Custom `AsyncTask`.
* [`android.util.LruCache`](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/Bird_Quiz_App/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/birdquiz/BitmapImageCache.java) for caching the Bitmaps downloaded.
* `android.os.CountDownTimer` for the Quiz Timer. Headless [`Fragment`](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/Bird_Quiz_App/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/birdquiz/CountDownLatchFragment.java) has been used for managing the `CountDownTimer`, designed as a latch that adds functionality such as _Pause_ and _Resume_.
* [`DialogFragment`](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/Bird_Quiz_App/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/birdquiz/QuestionNumberPickerDialogFragment.java) to display the Number Picker Dialog for the user to select/enter the number of questions to attempt.
* [`DialogFragment`](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/Bird_Quiz_App/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/birdquiz/ProgressDialogFragment.java) for displaying the Progress of Image Download, with a custom progress bar layout.
* [`DialogFragment`](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/Bird_Quiz_App/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/birdquiz/FinalScoreDialogFragment.java) for displaying the Final score at the end of the quiz or when the quiz timer elapses.
* Intents for moving from one activity to the other.
* [Id resource](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/Bird_Quiz_App/app/src/main/res/values/ids.xml) for the components generated programmatically.
* Nine patch images used as a background image for the question and option fields.
* [Level List Drawable](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/Bird_Quiz_App/app/src/main/res/drawable/option_level_list.xml) for decorating the options.
* [State List Drawable](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/Bird_Quiz_App/app/src/main/res/drawable/button_state_selector.xml) of shape drawables with gradient for the Submit/Hint buttons.
* [String array](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/Bird_Quiz_App/app/src/main/res/values/quiz_strings.xml) resources for storing the questions, their options and keys.

**Rhythm** App is a Musical Structure App that showcases a structure/approach typically used for Apps that play music, without implementing its functionality. Each screen in the App displays a Text describing about the screen and what functionality goes into it. Mocking or adding real content is not allowed as per the Project Rubric. Static data from resources are only allowed. As mock up is not allowed, `AdapterView`s and `RecyclerView`s are not used. This enables more practice with using layouts. Hence, the Project mainly focuses on App designing. 

#### Topics learnt/explored
* Fiddled with `CoordinatorLayout` along with `CollapsibleToolbar` and `DrawerLayout`.
* Used `ConstraintLayout` heavily for most of the layouts along with custom `styles`.
* Created a custom [WindowInsetsFrameLayout](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/RhythmApp/blob/udacity/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/rhythm/extensions/WindowInsetsFrameLayout.java) for dispatching the Window insets from the DrawerLayout to the Fragments shown in this FrameLayout's container, when its `FitSystemWindows` property is set.
* Implemented Base class architecture for abstracting the common tasks to be executed by Activities and Fragments. 
* Persistent Bottom Player is shown in many Fragments and Activities. [PlayerActivity](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/RhythmApp/blob/udacity/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/rhythm/ui/common/activities/PlayerActivity.java) and [PlayerFragment](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/RhythmApp/blob/udacity/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/rhythm/ui/common/fragments/PlayerFragment.java) extends the Base classes for Activities and Fragments respectively to abstract the implementation details of the persistent `Bottom Sheet`.
* Common tasks of the Drawer Fragments shown in the `HomeActivity` are abstracted by [DrawerFragment](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/RhythmApp/blob/udacity/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/rhythm/ui/common/fragments/DrawerFragment.java) abstract class that extends the `PlayerFragment` abstract class, as they also need to show the Persistent Bottom Player.
* Music Player controls are simulated by using a Bound Service [PlayerService](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/RhythmApp/blob/udacity/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/rhythm/ui/common/services/PlayerService.java). It provides the necessary Play/Pause/Restart methods to control the Player progress value generated by an Internal Worker Thread.
* Implemented a custom `AppBarLayout` [Behavior](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/RhythmApp/blob/udacity/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/rhythm/extensions/BottomSheetAwareAppBarBehavior.java) to control the Nested scroll events on Layouts with Bottom Sheets, to prevent the scroll from being consumed by the Layout behind the Bottom Sheet when a scroll event occurs on the Expanded Bottom Sheet.
* Implemented a custom `FloatingActionButton` [Behavior](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/RhythmApp/blob/udacity/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/rhythm/extensions/ScrollAwareAnchoredFabBehavior.java) to control the visibility and appearance of the `FloatingActionButton` when anchored to views other than `AppBarLayout` or views with `BottomSheetBehavior`, as these are taken care by default.
* Implemented a [BottomSheetDialogFragment](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/RhythmApp/blob/udacity/app/src/main/java/com/example/kaushiknsanji/rhythm/ui/jukebox/JukeboxDetailPaymentDialogFragment.java) to show a dialog appearing from the Bottom, to capture the Payment when the user tries to play a song from any of the Jukebox services, to simulate the Paid service.
* Used Animated Vector Drawables for transitioning between "Play-Pause" and "Like-Unlike" drawables through animations.
